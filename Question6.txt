2.Insertion and deletion in array can be done at any index in the array.

3.Stack has a dynamic size.	
3.Array has a fixed size.

4.Stack can contain elements of different data type.	
4.Array contains elements of same data type.

5.We can do only linear search	
5.We can do both linear and Binary search
