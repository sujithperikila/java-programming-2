 Following are the generally used ways for traversing trees.
1.InOrder  (left , root , right)
2.PreOrder (root, left, right)
3.PostOrder (left, right, root)

Suppose a Tree of 1,2,3,4,5 is present, Represented in a way like:

			1
		            /    \
		           2     3
		         /    \
		       4       5

Inorder
Tree is traversed in the order of LeftNode, RootNode, RightNode
Example: Inorder traversal for the above stated tree is 4 2 5 1 3.

Postorder
Tree is traversed in the order of LeftNode, RightNode, RootNode
Example: Postorder traversal for the above stated tree is 4 5 2 3 1.

PreOrder
Tree is traversed in the order of RootNode,LeftNode, RightNode
Example: PreOrder traversal for the above stated tree is 1 2 4 5 3.
