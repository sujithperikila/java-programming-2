Insertion, deletion, searching of an element is faster in BINARY SEARCH TREE than BINARY TREE due to the ordered characteristics
Whereas BINARY TREE is unordered hence slower in process of insertion, deletion and searching.IN BINARY TREE there is no ordering in terms of how the nodes are arranged.
In BINARY SEARCH TREE the left subtree has elements less than the nodes element and the right subtree has elements greater than the nodes element.

Hence, the complexity of searching an element in a node is faster in Binary Search Tree than that of Binary Tree. Hence, it is more efficient.
